/**
 * Deck
 * - 52 cards (should each card be its own class? Should it be an object with 3 values?)
 *  - Rank ("name value")
 *  - Suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades)
 *  - Value
 * - a way to shuffle
 * - a way to pass the cards to the players (should this be in my Deck? or my game logic?)
 *
 * Players (do I need a player class? or can I just put it in my game logic?)
 * - Name?
 * - Score
 * - Hand
 *
 * Logic to actually play the game... we can use a Deck in any card game,
 *   but we're playing a specific one.
 * - Ways to compare the cards... number values on each card
