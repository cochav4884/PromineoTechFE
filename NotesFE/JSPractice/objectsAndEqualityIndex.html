    <h1>Objects & Equality</h1>
    <p>What is an Object in JavaScript?

        An Object is a group of properties and methods.  A property is an association between a key:value pair, where the key is the property name, and the value is the value that we are assigning to that property.
        
        In JavaScript, Objects can be defined (or created) a few ways:
        
        with an Object Literal or Object Initializer
        By using a Constructor function
        By using the Object.create() method.
        In this section, we will look at creating an Object by using an Object Literal.  Let's take a look at a simple Contact List Object:
        
        var contactOne = {
        firstName:"Mickey",
        lastName: "Mouse",
        address: {
        street: "1 Main Street",
        city: "Disneyland",
        state: "CA",
        zip: "92802"
        },
        phone: "123-456-7890",
        notes: ""
        };
        
        
        Let's look at how we access the properties here.  To get to a property within an object, we need to use dot notation as follows:
        
        console.log(contactOne.firstName + " " + contactOne.lastName 
        +  " lives in " + contactOne.address.city + " " 
        + contactOne.address.state);
        
        
        </p>

        <h1>Equality vs Identity</h1>
        <p>//Equality vs Identity (Both are boolean operators)
            //Equality (==) checks if the values are equal. Example: (2 == '2' is true) (Use only as a last resort for an exception)
            // 3 operators are used to compare values in JavaScript. ==, ===, and !=. 
            //Identity (===) checks if the values are equal and the types are the same. Example: (2 === '2' is false) (Use as default as the rule of thumb)
            
            // == is used to compare two values, but it ignores the datatype of variable.
            console.log(2 == '2'); //prints true. (2 is equal to '2')
            
            // === is usedto compare two values, but it checks the datatype of variable.
            console.log(2 === '2'); //prints false. (2 is not equal to '2')
            
            
            // != is used to compare two values, but it ignores the datatype of variable.
            console.log(2 != '2'); //prints false. (2 is equal to '2')</p>
