    <h1>Class</h1>
    In JavaScript, there are many built-in classes (e.g. Date, etc), so you may have already used JavaScript classes.  Classes give developers the ability of code organization, and are a foundation of object-oriented programming.
    Classes allow the creation of objects that store internal data, and expose behavior to users of those objects. 
    Classes also allow private fields, which means data can be hidden from users if necessary. 
    Related functions can be organized within the Class to which they belong, 
    
    In this section, we are going to be declaring a new class.  Classes can do the following:
    Constructor:  Using the new operator, classes are used to create objects.
    Instance Methods and Instance Fields:  Each object has properties (data and/or methods) added by the class
    Static Methods and Static Fields:  The class itself can also store properties (data and/or methods) with are used to interact with instances of the class.  
    
    Here is a JavaScript example of a class declaration, including an instantiation.
    
    This is animal.js:
    class Animal {
    constructor(name, type, weight, height, location) {
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    this.weight = weight;
    this.height = height;
    this.location = location;
    }
    
    describe() {
    console.log("Animal Description");
    console.log("------------------");
    console.log("\tName: " + this.name);
    console.log("\tType: " + this.type);
    console.log("\tWeight: " + this.weight + " lb.");
    console.log("\tHeight: " + this.height + " in.");
    console.log("\tLocation: " + this.location);
    }
    }
    
    let elephant = new Animal("Dumbo", "elephant", 8000, 108, "Disneyland");
    elephant.describe();
