    <h1>Boolean Values</h1>
    <p>Are essential in these comparisons. With each decision we need the computer to make, we eventually answer in yes or no manner -- JavaScript, yes or no is represented by:
        <ul>
            <li>true</li>
            <li>false</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        5 == 4 prints: false
        <p>5 is not equal to 4</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        5 > 4 prints: true
        <p>5 is greater than 4</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        5 < 4 prints: false
        <p>5 is not less than 4</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        5 >= 4 prints: true
        <p>5 is greater than 4 even though it is not equal to 4</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        5 <= 4 prints: false
        <p>5 is not less than or equal to 4</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        5 > 4 && 4 > 2 prints: true
        <p>
          both statements have to be true and 5 is greater than 4, likewise 4 is
          greater than 2
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        4 > 10 || 1 == 1 prints: true
        <p>
          only one statement has to be true 4 is not greater than 10, but 1 is
          equal to 1
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
