    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <p>
        An array in JavaScript is a container which holds a number of values.   You can set a length of an array when it is declared, but you can always add elements to this.

Some useful array information and vocabulary is contained here:

<ul>
    <li>new Array() or  [] tell JavaScript that we are declaring an array</li>
    <li>element:  each item stored in an array is called an element</li>
    <li>index:  each element in an array is found or accessed by its numerical index.</li>
    <li>arrays are zero-based, so the index values start at 0.</li>
    <li>the first element in any array is located at index:  0</li>
    <li>the last element of any array is located at index:   arrayName.length - 1</li>
    <li>additional elements can be added to an array by using:  arrayName.push(newValue);
Just like any variable in JavaScript, an array must be declared.  We declare the array to give it a name.</li>
</ul>

    Let's look at a Grade Book Example.  Imagine that I have a College Programming Course that has 5 coding assignments.  For our example, I will set the values of the grades.
    <p>
        Coding Challenge:  As a stretch, you could convert these examples to use prompt() and alert() as was described in the User Input Section of Week 2: Weekly Videos and Curriculum (e.g. request the Student name, and the grades).

    <h3>List and Position of an Array</h3>
    [a b c d e f] = [0 1 2 3 4 5]
    <p>An array list contains a number of items: in this case 6 items are in our array list.
       The position of the items begin with position 0 and end with position 5. 
       The last item is always the number of items -1.
