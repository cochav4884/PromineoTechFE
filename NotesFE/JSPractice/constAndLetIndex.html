        History of JavaScript and ES6: <br>


        JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich.  JavaScript became an ECMA standard in 1997, <br> and is referenced by ECMA-262 -- ECMAScript® Language Specification. <br>
        
        Versions of ECMA-262 -- ECMAScript® Language Specification are as follow: <br>
        ES1 - ECMAScript 1 in 1997:  Original version <br>
        ES2 - ECMAScript 2 in 1998:  Edits to the Original version <br>
        ES3 - ECMAScript 3 in 1999:  Added try/catch, switch, do/while, etc. <br>
        ES4 - ECMAScript 4:   not released <br>
        ES5 - ECMAScript 5 in 2009:  The first major revision of the JavaScript language <br>
        ES6 - ECMAScript 2015:   The second major revision of the JavaScript language <br>
        Yearly Updates: <br>
        ES7 - ECMAScript 2016 <br>
        ES8 - ECMAScript 2017 <br>
        ES9 - ECMAScript 2018 <br>
        ES10 - ECMAScript 2019 <br>
        ES11 - ECMAScript 2020 <br>
        ES12 - ECMAScript 2021 <br>
        Version 13 ES2022 - ECMAScript 2022 <br>
        
        ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is also known as ECMAScript 2015.  ES6 is the most recent major revision of the ECMAScript Standard of the JavaScript language, and includes a number of additions which are extremely useful, including the following ones that will be covered in our videos here: <br>
        The let keyword <br>
        The const keyword <br>
        Template Literals <br>
        Arrow Functions <br>
        Promises
