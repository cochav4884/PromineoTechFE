    <h1>Template Literal</h1>
    <h3>User Input</h3>
    <p>
        Will learn in Week 7. ECMAScript6 instroduces a concept called Template Literals.
        <ul>
            <li> `Any random text ${variableName}`
                <p>A Template Literal uses something called a backtick instead of using single or double quotes; and when used creates a string, evaluating any variables contained inside the backticks which are placed in a construct like this:</p>
            </li> 
            <li> welcome.alert(`Welcome, ${name}`);
                <p>The User Input video uses the following Template Literal (bold in this example using backticks): </p>
            </li>
            <li>  welcome.alert('Welcome, ' + name);
                <p>The Template Literal creates a string that will print out the exact same result as this code which uses string concatenation (with single quotes):</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Template literals are extremely useful, and you will learn much more about them in Week 7.  Specifically in the Week 7: Weekly Videos and Curriculum Tile under 2. ES6 Template Literals
