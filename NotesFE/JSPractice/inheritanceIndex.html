    <h1>Inheritance</h1>

    Inheritance is one of the Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming, and is key
    when reusing code in an Object-Oriented program. It is possible to reuse
    properties and methods when a new class is created from an existing class.
    Use the keyword extends to inherit properties and methods from a different
    class. In the following example, the first class created is Person and then
    the Teacher class is created using extends Person Here is an example: class
    Person { constructor (newName) { this.name = newName; } introduce() { return
    `My name is ${this.name}.`; } } class Teacher extends Person { constructor
    (name, courseName) { super(name); this.courseName = courseName; }
    introduceSelf() { console.log(`My name is ${this.name}, and I will be
    teaching your ${this.courseName} class.`); } } let teacher = new
    Teacher('Ms. Angle', 'Trigonometry'); console.log(teacher.introduce());
    teacher.introduceSelf(); Other things to note is the use of Template
    Literals in the introduce() method in Person, and also in the
    introduceSelf() method in Teacher. Notice that both of those are able to be
    called on the variable teacher. Coding challenge: Modify this simple example
    to add additional properties to the Person class, and then use those
    properties within the Teacher class.
