    <h1>Menu App</h1>
    Overview:
    Prompting users for input to make a decision on which code path will be executed is a great way for a user to be able to accomplish required tasks in the correct order.  
    
    Reminder:  
    In Week 2: Videos and Curriculum  -- 3. User Input, we discussed how getting input from users allows the program to dynamically choose the correct path based on the users choices.    
    
    This section of our curriculum will focus on creating multiple classes that interact, and have properties and methods.
    
    Alternate Implementation -- Using UNUSED methods:
    There are a number of methods that are created in this video series that are not used in the video implementation.  The unused methods allow you to change the implementation if desired.   
    
    Here is a list of the unused methods:
    In the Player class:
    describe()  -- notice that the implementation changed a bit to allow it to be used
    In the Team class:
    describe()
    addPlayer()
    Below  is an alternative way to implement the code from the videos using the above list of  methods.  Look for the italicized commented out code, and the bold replacement code. 
    
    This code is in menu.js:
    
    // Teams and Players on those teams
    class Player {
    constructor(name, position) {
    this.name = name;
    this.position = position;
    }
    
    describe() {
    //console.log(`${this.name} plays ${this.position}`)
    return `${this.name} plays ${this.position}`;
    }
    }
    class Team {
    constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.players = [];
    }
    
    addPlayer(player) {
    if (player instanceof Player) {
    this.players.push(player);
    } else {
    throw new Error(`You can only add an instance of Player. 
    argument is not a player: ${player}`);
    }
    }
    
    describe() {
    return `${this.name} has ${this.players.length} players.`;
    }
    }
    class Menu { // what drives the application and our choices
    constructor() {
    this.teams = [];
    this.selectedTeam = null; // manage one team at a time
    }
    
    start() { // entry point to application
    let selection = this.showMainMenuOptions(); 
    while (selection != 0) {
    switch(selection) {
    case '1' :
    this.createTeam();
    break;
    case '2' :
    this.viewTeam();
    break;
    case '3' :
    this.deleteTeam();
    break;
    case '4' :
    this.displayTeams();
    break;
    default:
    selection = 0;
    }
    selection = this.showMainMenuOptions();
    }
    alert('Goodbye!');
    }
    
    
    showMainMenuOptions() {
    return prompt(`
    0) exit
    1) create a new team
    2) view a team
    3) delete a team
    4) display all teams
    `);
    }
    
    showTeamMenuOptions(teamInfo) {
    return prompt(`
    0) back
    1) add a new player
    2) delete a player
    -----------------
    ${teamInfo}
    `);
    }
    
    displayTeams() {
    let teamString = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < this.teams.length; i++) {
    teamString += i+ ') ' + this.teams[i].name + '\n';
    }
    alert(teamString);
    }
    
    createTeam() {
    let name = prompt('Enter name for new team: ');
    this.teams.push(new Team(name));
    }
    
    viewTeam() {
    let index = prompt("Enter the index of the team that you want to view:");
    if (index > -1 && index < this.teams.length) {
    this.selectedTeam = this.teams[index];
    let description = 'Team Name: ' + this.selectedTeam.name + '\n';
    description += ' ' + this.selectedTeam.describe() + '\n ';
    for (let i = 0; i < this.selectedTeam.players.length; i++) {
    // description += i + ') ' + this.selectedTeam.players[i].name + ' - '
    // + this.selectedTeam.players[i].position + '\n';
    description += i + ') ' + this.selectedTeam.players[i].describe() + '\n';
    }
    let selection1 = this.showTeamMenuOptions(description);
    switch (selection1) {
    case '1' :
    this.createPlayer();
    break;
    case '2' :
    this.deletePlayer();
    }
    } // validate user input
    }
    
    deleteTeam() {
    let index = prompt('Enter the index of the team that you wish to delete: ');
    if (index > -1 && index < this.teams.length) {
    this.teams.splice(index,1);
    }
    }
    
    
    createPlayer() {
    let name = prompt('Enter name for new player: ');
    let position = prompt('Enter position for new player: ');
    //this.selectedTeam.players.push(new Player(name, position));
    this.selectedTeam.addPlayer(new Player(name,position));
    }
    
    deletePlayer() {
    let index = prompt('Enter the index of the player that you wish to delete: ');
    if (index > -1 && index < this.selectedTeam.players.length) { this.selectedTeam.players.splice(index,1);
    }
    }
    }
    let menu = new Menu();
    menu.start();
    
    
    The implementation of these methods gives you options when you begin to code your own version of a Menu Driven Application.  You can write a describe() function for each class (Object), and use that to display the object as we have shown above.
    
    Additionally, there are two ways to add a player in this application.  Using the function that was written addPlayer() is an Object-Oriented way to implement this functionality.   It is beneficial to see multiple ways of coding the same functionality.
