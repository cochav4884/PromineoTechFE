    <h1>Intermediate Array Methods</h1>
    <p>When using methods on arrays, it's important to refer to the documentation on exactly how each of these methods works.  

        arrayName.every()  Example:
        
        In our GradeBook example, what if we wanted to decide if every grade in the GradeBook array was a passing grade.  Passing in this example is a 70 or above.
        
        let fullName = "Mary" + " " + "Brown"; 
        let gradesArray = [100, 79, 80, 90, 100];
        const isPassing = (currentValue) => currentValue >= 70;
        
        console.log("\n\nStudent: " + fullName);
        console.log("Grades: ");
        for (let i = 0; i < gradesArray.length; i++) { 
        console.log("\t" + (i+1) + ": " + gradesArray[i]);
        }
        console.log("Evaluation: ");
        
        if (gradesArray.every(isPassing)) {
        console.log('\tEvery grade is a passing grade (>= 70)!');
        } else {
        console.log('\tNot all grades are passing.  A passing grade is >= 70!');
        }
        
        
        What would happen if we added a grade of 55 to our array?  Note:  You need the above declarations of fullName, gradesArray and isPassing to run the following code.
        
        gradesArray.push(55);
        console.log("\n\nStudent: " + fullName);
        console.log("Grades: ");
        for (let i = 0; i < gradesArray.length; i++) { 
        console.log("\t" + (i+1) + ": " + gradesArray[i]);
        }
        console.log("Evaluation: ");
        
        if (gradesArray.every(isPassing)) {
        console.log('\tEvery grade is a passing grade (>= 70)!');
        } else {
        console.log('\tNot all grades are passing.  A passing grade is >= 70!');
        }</p>
