    <h1>React Router & Testing</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>SPA vs MPA: Understand the differences between Single Page Applications and Multi-Page Applications.</li>
        <li>React Router: Implement client-side routing with React Router, including nested routes and URL parameters.</li>
        <li>Intergration Testing: Use React Testing Library to write and run integration tests, ensuring your application functions correctly.</li>
        <li>Project Work: Start your final project by setting up React Router pages and integration tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UI: React UseEffect Hook</h2>
    <p>useEffect(() => {
        //do something
    }, DEPENDENCY_ARRAY)</p>
    <ul>

    <h3>React Component</h3>
    <p>An oftern pure, mostly declarative function that can take in props as input and returns JSX as output</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pure Function: Does not have side effects, always gives the same output for the same input</li>
        <li>Impure Function: Has side effects, does not always give the same output for the same input</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you need a pure function to have a side effect, use a:</p>
    <h3>React Effect</h3>
    <p>A side effect of rendering that needs to run outside of the pure rendering function.</p>

    <p>To attach a side effect to a pure function:
        <p>
            <h2>UI: React UseEffect Hook: takes two parameters:</h2>
            <p>useEffect(() => {
                //do something
            }, DEPENDENCY_ARRAY)</p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>first parameter: "//do something" is what is ran after rendering is complete</li>
            <li>second parameter: DEPENDENCY_ARRAY; The effect will run when the dependency array changes.</li>
        </ul>

        UseEffect Hook will only run if the dependendy array changes. If it does not change, the UseEffect Hook will not run again.
    </p>
    <h3>Three Options for the dependency array:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No dependency array <p>
            <p>useEffect(() => {
                //do something
            })</p>
            <p>This will run the effect after every render.</p> 
        </p> Run on every render (we don't usually do this)</li>
        <li>Full dependency array <p>
            <p>useEffect(() => {
                //do something
            }, [DEPENDENCY1, DEPENDENCY2])</p>
            <p>This will run the effect only when the dependencies change.</p>
        </p> Run on first render, and later renders where some or thing has changed since the last render</li>

        <li>Empty dependency array <p>
            <p>useEffect(() => {
                //do something
            }, [])</p>
            <p>This will run the effect only once, after the initial render.</p>
        </p> Run on first render</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>If Strict Mode is being used: (should leave strict mode on) this happens when strict mode is on:</h3>
    <p>Does some extra checks, only in development mode, to help catch bugs <br> 
    One of those checks is to load, unload, and load again when a component first loads in.</p>

    <h3>When do we use an Effect?</h3>
    <p>For behavior triggered by rendering that isn't part of rendering, usually to sync with an external system</p>
    <h4>Most common examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Fetching data from the backend</li>
        <li>2. Starting a loading-in animation</li>
        <li>3. To interface with a DOM-manipulation-based system or widget</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Warning:</h4>
    <p>Before you reach for useEffect, make sure you couldn't just do it in an event listener or rendering code!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are you sure it's triggered by rendering? <p>
            If not, then it's probably triggered by a user event, so put it in the event handler instead.</p>
        </p></li>
        <li>Are you sure it's not part of rendering? <p>
            If it is part of rendering, then put it directly in the rendering function instead.</p>
        </p></li>
    </ul>
