    Chrome DevTools:

The Google Chrome browser has a built-in set of web developer tools.   These DevTools will help you edit pages dynamically, and allow diagnosis of problems quickly.  The ultimate goal of using DevTools is to allow a developer to build a better website, and to build them faster!


There are many ways to open DevTools, because different users want quick access to different parts of the DevTools UI.



When you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel. Or press the following:
- Command+Option+C (Mac) 
- Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, ChromeOS)


When you want to see logged messages or run JavaScript, jump straight into the Console panel by pressing the following:
- Command+Option+J (Mac) 
- Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, ChromeOS)
