    <h1>Week 14: Hooks & State</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>React Bootstrap: Integrate Bootstrap in React applications for streamlined UI development.</li>
        <li>Hooks: Dive into hooks with a focus on useState and useEffect.</li>
        <li>State Management: Manage state effectively, update complex state, and lift state up as needed.</li>
        <li>Project Work: Apply these concepts to move data into state, implement delete functionality, and perform simple create/update operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UI: Introduction to React</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>React Bootstrap: A library that provides Bootstrap components as React components.</li>
        <li>React Router: A library for routing in React applications, allowing navigation between different views.</li>
        <li>React Icons: A library that provides popular icons as React components.</li>
        <li>React Bootstrap Icons: A library that provides Bootstrap icons as React components.</li>
        <li>React Bootstrap Table: A library that provides a table component for displaying data in a tabular format.</li>
        <li>React Bootstrap Modal: A library that provides a modal component for displaying content in a dialog.</li>
        <li>React Bootstrap Form: A library that provides form components for building forms in React applications.</li>
        <li>React Bootstrap Alert: A library that provides alert components for displaying messages to users.</li>
        <li>React Bootstrap Card: A library that provides card components for displaying content in a card format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>State Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>State: A built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component.</li>
        <li>useState: A hook that allows you to add state to functional components.</li>
        <li>useEffect: A hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components.</li>
        <li>Updating State: Use the updater function returned by useState to update state based on previous state.</li>
        <li>Lifting State Up: Move state up to a common ancestor component when multiple components need access to the same state.</li>
        <li>Complex State: Manage complex state using useReducer or by structuring state as an object.</li>
        <li>State Management Libraries: Explore libraries like Redux or MobX for more complex state management needs.</li>
        <li>Context API: Use the Context API to share state across components without prop drilling.</li>
        <li>Custom Hooks: Create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and state management.</li>
        <li>Performance Optimization: Use memoization techniques like useMemo and useCallback to optimize performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data Management: Move data into state and manage it effectively.</li>
        <li>Delete Functionality: Implement a delete function to remove items from the state.</li>
        <li>Create/Update Operations: Perform simple create and update operations on the state.</li>
        <li>UI Integration: Integrate the state management with the UI components for a seamless user experience.</li>
        <li>Testing: Test the components and state management logic to ensure everything works as expected.</li>
        <li>Documentation: Document the code and provide clear instructions for usage.</li>
        <li>Code Review: Conduct a code review to ensure best practices are followed.</li>
        <li>Deployment: Deploy the application to a hosting service for public access.</li>
        <li>Feedback: Gather feedback from users and make necessary improvements.</li>
        <li>Future Enhancements: Plan for future enhancements and features based on user feedback.</li>
        <li>Version Control: Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes and collaborate with others.</li>
    </ul>
