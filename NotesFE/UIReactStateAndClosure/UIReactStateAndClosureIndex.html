    <h2>User Interfaces</h2>
    <h3>React State & Closure</h3>
    <p>
        <!-- const [text, setText] = userState("old")
        const handleClick = () => {
            setText("new")
            console.log(text) // "old"
        } -->
        <p>
            What will handleClick log out? Why? <br>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> "old" because the state update is asynchronous 
            and the closure captures the initial value of `text` at the time of the 
            function creation.
        </p>

    <h3>Calling a State Setter:</h3>
    <h4>Warning</h4>
    <p>
        Calling a state setter will update the state for the next render, but it will not
        immediately change the value of the state variable in the current render.
    </p>

    <h3>Closure:</h3>
    <p>
        A function plus all the variables that were in scope when the function was created.
        This means that the function retains access to those variables even after they go out of scope.
