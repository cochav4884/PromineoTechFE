// Functional Programming
// Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.
// Positive aspects of functional programming:
// 1. Easier to reason about code: Functions are pure and do not have side effects, making it easier to understand the flow of data.
// 2. Higher-order functions: Functions can take other functions as arguments and return functions as results, allowing for more abstract and reusable code.
// 3. Immutability: Data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created. This leads to fewer bugs and easier debugging.
// 4. Recursion: Functional programming relies heavily on recursion, which can lead to more elegant solutions for certain problems.
// 5. Better for asynchronous programming: Functional programming is well-suited for asynchronous programming, as it allows for better handling of callbacks and promises.
// 6. Fewer Bugs: Functional programming reduces the chances of bugs by avoiding side effects and mutable state.
// 7. Easier to maintain: Functional code is often easier to maintain and refactor, as it is more modular and less dependent on external state.

// Negative aspects of functional programming:
// 1. Performance: Functional programming can be slower than imperative programming due to the overhead of function calls and recursion.
// 2. Learning curve: Functional programming can be difficult to learn for those who are used to imperative programming.
// 3. Debugging: Debugging functional code can be more challenging, as it can be harder to trace the flow of data and understand the state of the program.
// 4. Less control over state: Functional programming can make it harder to manage state, as data is immutable and cannot be changed.
// 5. Limited support in some languages: Not all programming languages support functional programming, which can limit its use in certain projects.
// 6. Can lead to complex code: Functional programming can lead to complex code that is difficult to understand, especially for those who are not familiar with the paradigm.
// 7. Less efficient for certain tasks: Functional programming can be less efficient for certain tasks, such as low-level programming or performance-critical applications.
